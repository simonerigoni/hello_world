# Hello World

Hi, I am Simone Rigoni and I am very passionate about Software Engineering and building stuff.

I graduated in Computer Engineering - Embedded and Control Systems at the [University of Pavia](http://wcm-3.unipv.it/site/en/home.html) in October 2017.

During my Erasmus Traineeship in Dublin I worked as Embedded Software Developer at [Firmwave](https://iot.taoglas.com/), a young company specialized in the design of low-power hardware for IoT. I developed in C with an open source toolchain based on GCC ARM + Eclipse + OpenOCD new features in both the bootloader and the application of OTA programming on a device based on MCU STM32F4 (equipped with ARM Cortex M4).

I got passionate about Python and how to use data to solve problems so I decided to completely change my working field approaching Data Engineering and Data Science.

From October 2017 to August 2020 I worked as Technical Consultant at [Aptos](https://www.aptos.com/) which operates a singular commerce platform that enables retail enterprises to deliver omni-channel shopping experiences to customers. One key aspect of my work are the performances of the code because of the high volume of data that are involved in the retail related business processes.

In 2019 I graduated from the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. It allowed me to deepen my theoretical and practical knowledge of Supervise, Unsupervised and Deep Learning.

From September 2020 I work as Data Engineer in the Data Platforms division of [Fastweb](https://www.fastweb.it/) which is a telecommunications company that provides landline, broadband Internet, IPTV and mobile services.
