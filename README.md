# Hello World

Hi, I am Simone Rigoni and I write about Software Development, Data Engineering, building stuff, travel, strength training and running. If you like the content I create feel free to buy me a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simonerigoni).

I graduated in Masterâ€™s Degree Computer Engineering - Embedded and Control Systems at the [University of Pavia](http://wcm-3.unipv.it/site/en/home.html) in 2017.

Even if my university career was mainly focused on Embedded Systems I got passionate about Python, SQL and how to use data to solve problems so I decided to completely change my working field approaching Data Engineering and Data Science.

After several years in the industry as Data Engineer, I now work exclusively as a 100% remote independent contractor. I build and maintain systems that collect, manage, and transform raw data into business usable information using Python, SQL and Azure or AWS tools depending on the client needs. With my knowledge of Qlikview, SSRS and PowerBI I can also contribute to visualize data and build reports. 

On my website [simonerigoni.net](http://www.simonerigoni.net), on [Medium](https://medium.com/@simone-rigoni01) and on [Blogspot](https://simonerigoni01.blogspot.com/) I write posts about Software Development, Data Engineering and Machine Learning.

 
Cheers

Simone
